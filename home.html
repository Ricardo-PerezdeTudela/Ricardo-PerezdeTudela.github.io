My scientific career has been mainly focused on the theoretical study of atomic and molec-
ular clusters, with a particular interest in describing, as accurately as possible, quantum
effects such as zero-point motion, tunneling or superfluidity. For small systems containing
maximum a handful of atoms there are different techniques available to directly solve the
Schrdinger equation, both in time-independent and time-dependent regimes. However, as
soon as the number of atoms exceeds four or five, approaches like path integral methods are
more suited to describe the quantum many-body problem.

The pioneering path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) [1] method developed by David Ceper-
ley in the 80’s and all the consequent variants that came afterwards, such as path integral
molecular dynamics (PIMD) [2], centroid molecular dynamics (CMD) [3–5], ring polymer
molecular dynamics (RPMD) [6, 7], etc., are nowadays the most adequate theoretical tools
to study quantum effects in realistic systems.

In particular, PIMC and PIMD make use of a smart factorization of the density matrix
of the quantum system in order to compute the partition function of the system. The
multidimensional integrals that appear naturally in the derivation must be computed using
either Monte Carlo or molecular dynamics sampling techniques. These two methods give
exact results for the properties of a static quantum system in thermodynamic equilibrium.
The dynamical properties of quantum systems can be computed using methods like CMD
or RPMD. The range of applicability of the path integral methodologies is immense, and
spans from very fundamental problems in Physics (like superfluid [8],or even supersolid [9]
helium) and Chemistry (structure [10, 11], chemical reactions [12], IR spectra [13], diffusion
processes [14, 15]) to Biology (proton transfers in proteins) [16, 17].
