During my career, I have gained almost 300 hours of teaching experience, 
in theoretical, exercises, computational and laboratory classes. 
Here is a list of the courses I have imparted:
<br>

<ol>
<li>One course of about 40 hours on Computational Physics Lab to 3rd-year Physics students at the Physics Department of the University of Reading (UK)</li>
<br>
<li>One course of 12 hours on Chemistry Lab to 1st-year Physics students at the Universidad Complutense de Madrid (Spain)</li>
<br>
<li>One course of 15 hours on Computational Chemistry Lab and Theoretical Chemistry to 2nd-year Chemistry students at the Universidad Complutense de Madrid (Spain)</li>
<br>
<li>One course of 28 hours on Chemistry Lab to 1st-year Materials Engineering students at the Universidad Complutense de Madrid (Spain)</li>
<br>
<li>Four courses of 24 hours each (total of 96 hours) on Theoretical Spectroscopy to Master’s students at the Ruhr-Universität Bochum Dynamics and simulation (Germany)</li>
